## Build Process

### Development Build

```bash
# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Run on connected device
./gradlew installDebug
adb shell am start -n com.clipforge/.MainActivity

# Check installation
adb shell pm list packages | grep clipforge
```

### Release Build

```bash
# Generate signing key (if needed)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore clipforge.keystore \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias clipforge

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Build App Bundle (for Google Play)
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Verify signing
jarsigner -verify -verbose clipforge-release.apk

# Check APK size and permissions
aapt dump badging clipforge-release.apk
```

### Version Management

```gradle
// In build.gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 34
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.clipforge"
        minSdkVersion 26

## Optimization for Release

### ProGuard Configuration

```proguard
# app/proguard-rules.pro

# Keep JNI methods
-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {
    native <methods>;
}

# Keep native library entry points
-keep class com.clipforge.android.engine.** { *; }
-keep class com.clipforge.android.views.** { *; }

# Keep exception classes
-keep class * extends java.lang.Exception { *; }

# Optimize
-optimizationpasses 5
-allowaccessmodification

# Shrink
-dontshrink
```

### MinifyEnabled Release

```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        shrinkResources true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

```gradle
// Enable split APKs for size reduction
android {
    bundle {
        language {
            enableSplit = true
        }
        density {
            enableSplit = true
        }
        abi {
            enableSplit = true
        }
